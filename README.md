# ts_gen_v2


## Installation
Run `make conda_env` to create the conda environment. 
The script will request the user to enter one of the supported CUDA versions listed here: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.
The script uses this CUDA version to install PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric. Alternatively, the user could manually follow the steps to install PyTorch Geometric here: https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/.travis.yml.
